Brite Core Hiring Test Project
==============================

This is a solution for the [ProductDevelopment project](https://github.com/IntuitiveWebSolutions/ProductDevelopmentProject) proposed by BriteCore.

It is divided in two parts:

* **Backend**: built with Django and Django Rest Framework, CRUD API that lets you manage RiskTypes and custom Fields for those Risks Types.
* **Frontend**: static site built with VueJS which uses the backend to query for RiskTypes and their field in order to build a form.
